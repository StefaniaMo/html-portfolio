        <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
            <p>
                Seeing it in IMAX was the best thing I've ever done. A movie that makes you say, 'Oh my God!' over and over again, in amazement and terror.

        <h3>The boy and the Heron</h3>
            <p>
                Hand-drawn by humans and not computers, the film has been said to combine some events from Miyazaki's own childhood, a filmmaker who, if he is indeed retiring, has done so with a swan song. Tangled, disturbing and fascinating.

        <h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
            <p>
                With a lot of humor and a lot of color, behind this circus with animals and everything there is a deeply human story. It would be desirable to see the film (or the entire trilogy) beyond the Marvel label or fashions.
